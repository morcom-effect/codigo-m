    <div>My name is Luis Rivera, I am a computer engineer currently working at Facebook.
        Philanthropy, technology, education, and human rights are among the things I am passionate about. I
        started The
        Morcom Effect with the desire to expose more students to the world of technology and the opportunities
        that
        exist in this field.
